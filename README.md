## Dependencies

    1. OpenCV
    2. OpenCL
    3. Boost Libraries

You have to have Boost libraries installed in the system for C++11 or else you might get issue during build process such as:

    $ fatal error: 'boost/lexical_cast.hpp' file not found

### OpenCV

For MAC OS X

    >> brew install opencv3

  You could follow this link for more info: [](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/)

For Ubuntu

  Follow this link: [](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
    
#### Alternatively try the following to install OpenCV3 on Ubuntu:

    >> [sudo] apt-get install opencv-data
    >> [sudo] apt-get install libopencv-dev
    
#### Check if OpenCV3 is installed properly:

    >> pkg-config --modversion opencv
    3.2.x
    
### OpenCL

For OpenCL installation for your specific system, check online (Google, may be).

If you are trying to install OpenCL on Ubuntu ten follow this:

    >> [sudo] apt install ocl-icd-libopencl1
    >> [sudo] apt install opencl-headers
    >> [sudo] apt install clinfo
    >> [sudo] apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
    
To test if OpenCL is installed on Ubuntu try the following command:
    
    >> clinfo

### Boost

To install Boost libraries use the following options as necessary:

For MAC OS X

    >> brew install boost --c++11

For Ubuntu

    >> sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev


## Installation

    >> git clone https://github.com/somdipdey/Face_Detection_using_OpenCV_and_OpenCL_in_CPlusPlus.git
    >> mv Face_Detection_using_OpenCV_and_OpenCL_in_CPlusPlus faces
    >> cd faces
    >> cmake .
    >> make

## Utilization

This will automatically detect webcam and start it and additionally write fps to an audit.csv file:

    >> ./faces -a

This will start the face detection on a video instead of camera:

    >> ./faces OUR_VIDEO_PATH

This will open camera with specific id:

    >> ./faces CAMERA_ID
